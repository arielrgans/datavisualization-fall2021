# Fall 2021 Northwestern Data Visualization
## Ariel Gans

One idea for a final class project addresses the question, how does an area’s housing supply change with resident racial demographics. There are maps showing the distribution of resident racial demographics and there are public data on housing surpluses by location. This story is timely because of increasing housing costs and recent changes in eviction moratoriums. I can talk to demographers and housing policy experts as sources for this. 

Data-driven investigation critique: 
[The Airbnb Effect](https://www.sfchronicle.com/airbnb-impact-san-francisco-2015/#1)

*Clarity and accuracy*

**Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations.**
Yes, I would give that a five.

**What was it?**
The central insight was that Airbnb and other vacation-rental company’s list hundreds of properties as full-time vacation rentals, but they are often not rented.

**Was it in the headline?**
No, but it was in the subheadline.

**If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent**
Yes, but I would give it a four.

**Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization?**
I would have preferred the years to be separated rather than aggregated.

**Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?**
Yes, I think the map could have had the names of the neighborhoods listed on them instead of needing you to drag your cursor to find out what each one was.

**Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate**
It's difficult to speak to this without knowing the methods the authors used to obtain the data. The article also does not say which numbers are averages and which are not. Given this, I would give the data a four.

**List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.**
I question the accuracy of the data on the pricing because that constantly changes and has a lot of factors built into it. I also think a median would have been better used for pricing in an area that has such varied prices. I think that the higher prices, when included in averages screw the results.

**List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.**
I think that the reporter should check with the analytics team for more sites besides AirBnb. He also should specificy what he means by "according to neighbors." It was confusing how many people that includes and who those people are given how many properties the story discussed.

**Did they provide a source?**
Yes. The author cited Wrede Petersmeyer, who "oversees Airbnb analytics" (no position title provided) and "neighbors".

**Did they explain everything that needed explaining?**
No.

*Quality*

**Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)**
Yes, I would give it a five.

**Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.**
The graphic was very responsive and had pop-up messages that opened and closed depending on where your cursor was on it. It also had the neighborhood that your cursor was over light up, which made it easy to see the area's boundaries and know what you're reading about.

*Type and color (if piece includes graphics)*

**Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?**
No.

**For example, did it:
**Look like it all belonged together?**
No.

**Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?**
Yes.

**Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?**
Sometimes.

**Type (1-5)**
3.5.

**Explain**
I thought as far as the graphics were concerned that the type was not used well. The font was fine. However, the placement of the words was awkwardly placed all over the bar chart and the type for the geographic visualization was in paragraphs. The latter made the graphic difficult to understand because its explanations were convoluted.

**Color (1-5)**
2.

**Explain**
They used dark red to indicate higher numbers, and lighter colors to indicated lower ones, which made sense. The blue and yellow in the bar chart did not though. Each color had three shades and the same shades were used to differentiate different things, which got confusing. What I thought made the least sense though was using white text in yellow text bozxes throughout the piece. It was difficult to read and was used for captions as well as pulled quotes.

*Creativity

**Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?**
Yes, but not much.

**How?**
The geographic visualization was creative and a good size (not too much information packed in). The bar chart did not seem particularly creative or necessary to me. It wasn't interactive, but it did help me visualize the numbers that the story talked about as they compare to each other.

**Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.**
4.
